# Neural Network

### We were tasked by the venture capital firm, Alphabet soup, with prediciting the success of an applicant using a neural network model.


## We were provided with both numerical and catgorical data in order to build the model. The company had an initial model which had two hidden layers and was set to run on 50 epochs. I was tasked to develop to alternate mmodels and to compare the results.

## The Original Model had an accuracy of 0.7308454513549805

## The Alternate model 1, was set up by using 3 nodes and a different functuion called "leaky_relu". It had an accuracy of 0.7303789854049683

## The Alternate model 2, was set up by keeping everything same but by increasing the number of epochs from 50 to 100. it had an accuracy of 0.4576093256473541


## From the results we can see that the original model and the Alternate model had almost identical results although slightly lower accuracy. But the Alternate Model 2 which was simply ran using the same model but ran for 100 epochs had very low accuracy.
